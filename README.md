# Portfolio-Page
Website that showcases my coding bootcamp projects. Built using HTML and CSS. 

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 2. <br>
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the CSS techiniques learned during the second module of the course. The website contains links to work done in previous modules and will be expanded to include future work. <br>
The main challenge was to use advanced CSS techniques to create visual enhancements and make the page responsive to different screen sizes.
